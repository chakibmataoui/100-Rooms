<h2>Engine document</h2>
<h3><u> Breif introduction :</u></h3>
<p>The design of the engine should fit the exact requirments of the game so that we can add more performant features to the game.
    <br />
   The modules needed for a game like this are simple : 
    <ul>
        <li>Game Box</li>
        <li>Player Interactions</li>
        <li>Game Logic</li>
        <li>Graphical</li>
        <li>Sound</li>
        <li>Text</li>
        <li>Ressource Manager</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<hr />
 <h2>Game Box :</h2>
    <p>The Game box is the actual window where the game is displayed and rendered the player should be able to switch between full and windowed screen in the option menu inside the game and it should contain the game loop and level managment</p>
<h2>Player Interactions</h2>
    <p>This should manage the input of the user so he can interact with the game the UI is a part of the graphical engine so the mouse interaction is coded inside the GameBox i guess for now we'll see later</p>
<h2>Game Logic</h2>
    <p>Since the game logic has its own module for scripting the game so it should contain all what we need to manage the init update draw loop</p>
